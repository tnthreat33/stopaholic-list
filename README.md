# Stopaholic-List
This will be an application that allows users to track their spending by the items they didn't purchase. Instead of buying items they can add them to the list to keep track of how much they saved by not purchasing items on impulse. At the end of the month they can decide to do what they want with the money they saved. A few suggestions we have: move it to a travel fund or savings for a big project, take a portion saved and spend it on the items you really want after waiting.
